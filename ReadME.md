#  Made by SwiftUI and SpriteKit


Used only one libary this is Alamofire (use standart calls api it`s awful)

For WebView adds custom swipe for back to game and reset game state

Fix leaks for memory (use a lot of timers for game)

some times take a bugs when web view can`t fast load a page (need to deep search what problem is it) stats of problem 1 in 10 fast games when you try hard to lose

add obstacles (they can move too like a platform)


first try to do something in sprite kit (looks intersting)
